# ATM System by WPI



### About this project

For this task, you are going to implement an ATM system that allows users to manage
their accounts. There are two types of users: Customers and Administrators. Both are
presented with their own menus (after login). Customers can use the system to
withdraw cash, deposit cash, and get their current balance. For simplicity, assume a
customer can have only 1 account (so they canâ€™t have a savings AND checking account
or a Joint account with a spouse, for example). Administrators can view, create,
delete, and update accounts of customers. All data should be stored in a MySQL
database and the program is a console application (not a web app).
